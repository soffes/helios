# Helios

In the theme of naming things after spacecraft, my home in Noe Valley is named after [Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_(spacecraft)) since it is closer to center of the city and Helios was a sun probe.

This is my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) configuration for my home.
